## Genomic traits derived from NEON dataset

Here we used metagenomes collected from the National Ecological Observation Network (NEON) to assess the distribution of genomic traits between soil microbial communities. For each of the ~400 metagenomes analyzed in this dataset, we derived a community average genome size, GC content, codon frequency, and amino acid frequency. Through the comparison of these traits across over 100 environmental and edaphic parameters, we were able to determine the predominant drivers of genomic traits in soil bacteria across a continental scale. 

## To do before making public

1) Remove NEON token ID from scripts
2) Remove reference and paper drafts folder
3) Remove prelim figs (useful to have them for now)
