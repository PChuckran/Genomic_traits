Fire is likely to impact site either directly burning the site, having fire retardant dropped on the site, or will be indirectly impacted once ash and debris moves into the site with a storm event. https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6773/# Update as of 20200618 at 10AM local time, fire is ~115,000 acres. Fire hasn't burned the site, and a line is being maintained just west of the site along state highway 87. As of 20200701, the fire is 98% contained and is only burning within the secured perimeter of the fire. The total acreage is 193,455 acres. SYCA was not burned. Reports of water being used from nearby pond to help control fire over the past few weeks. While we have not been to the site to confirm any impact, we are assuming no areas at the site were impacted by the fire.
